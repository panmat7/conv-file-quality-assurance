# conv-file-quality-assurance

**conv-file-quality-assurance** is a cross-platform application designed to verify the integrity and quality of files that have been converted from their original format to archival formats. It performs a series of in-depth comparisons and checks, such as visual differences, metadata mismatches, and structural inconsistencies, to ensure the preservation process retains fidelity.

## üèõÔ∏èBackground

This project is a proposal from Innlandet Fylkeskommune for a bachelor thesis at NTNU's programming program. It addresses a key issue in the automatic conversion of documents to archival formats‚Äînamely, the potential for errors and inconsistencies during conversion.

The Innlandet County Archive, one of Norway‚Äôs largest inter-municipal archives, receives a wide variety of digital documents from 48 municipalities. Many of these documents arrive in formats not suited for long-term archival storage, requiring conversion to approved archival formats.

A previous NTNU thesis developed an automated conversion tool. However, during conversion, loss of data or visual discrepancies can occur. Because of the large volume of files, manual inspection is not feasible.

To solve this, the archive requested the development of a quality assurance tool that can automatically detect potential issues in converted files. This project aims to fulfill that need‚Äîreducing manual work and increasing reliability in the archival process.

## üöÄKey features
- Pixel-by-pixel visual comparisons of images or document pages
- Detection of metadata differences (resolution, color space, bit depth, etc.)
- Table break detection in spreadsheets converted to PDFs
- Font, animation, and transparency detection
- PDF page count comparisons
- Extraction and verification of embedded images
- JSON report generation with severity-based error classification

---

## üß™Comparison Methods 
Each method performs a specific type of comparison between original and converted files:

- **File Size** ‚Äì Compares raw file sizes.
- **Pixel-by-Pixel** ‚Äì Calculates Euclidean distance between color values for each pixel.
- **Color Space** ‚Äì Identifies missing or altered color spaces.
- **Fonts** ‚Äì Flags missing or replaced fonts.
- **Number of Pages** ‚Äì Detects discrepancies in page count.
- **Animations** ‚Äì Flags the presence or absence of animations in presentation files.
- **Image Resolution** ‚Äì Compares DPI and resolution metadata.
- **Visual Document Comparison** ‚Äì Hybrid method: compares document layout + pixel comparisons.
- **Transparency Check** ‚Äì Detects use of transparency layers.
- **Table Break Check** ‚Äì Flags if tables/images are split across multiple pages in PDFs.
- **Metadata Comparison** ‚Äì Compares physical dimensions, bit depth, resolution, etc.
- **Extracted Metadata Check** ‚Äì Extracts images from documents and checks embedded metadata  
  _NOTE: This method may trigger frequently; severity could be reduced._

## üìòUsage Guide

1. **Choose original and converted folders.**  
   To extract metadata only, select a single directory and press **"Extract"**.

2. **Click "Load"** to pair original and converted files.  
   Optionally load from a **checkpoint JSON** to resume interrupted runs.
   - To do this, check **"Start from Checkpoint"** and select a saved checkpoint JSON report.

3. **Configure checks** using the **Settings** tab or **Quick Settings**.
   - You can also exclude certain file formats from verification in the Settings tab.

4. **Click "Start"** to begin the verification process.

5. Once complete, a JSON report will be saved in the `reports/` folder (created in the working directory).

6. **View the report**:
   - Go to the **"Report"** tab.
   - Click **"Load from JSON"** and select the report to view results.

7. **Test Analysis Tab**:
   - Navigate to the **"Test Analysis"** tab to view a general overview of test failures by severity.

> ‚è≥ **Note**: The console prints progress every 5 minutes with estimated time remaining.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Severity Levels**: Errors are categorized as **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**.  
>    - **Low** should be considered warnings and not always critical.

## ‚ö†Ô∏èKnown Issues & Limitations

- **Table break check** currently works only for PDFs with standard A4 or letter-sized pages.
- **Extracted metadata comparison** may over-report differences. We are evaluating lowering the severity of these alerts.
- Some Emgu.CV-based checks may not function if system dependencies are missing (especially on Linux).

---

## ‚úÖTesting & Validation

- Application manually tested on:
  - **Windows 10 & 11**
  - **Ubuntu 22.04**
- JSON output reports pass internal consistency checks.
- Planned: Schema validation for report files to ensure correctness.
